Level 2: Hint 2
================

People often accidentally add secret things to git repos, and then try to remove them without revoking or rolling the secrets.  You can look through the history of a git repo by running:

```
git log
```

Then you can look at what a git repo looked like at the time of a commit by running:

```
git checkout f7cebc46b471ca9838a0bdd1074bb498a3f84c87
```

where `f7cebc46b471ca9838a0bdd1074bb498a3f84c87` would be the hash for the commit shown in `git log`.
