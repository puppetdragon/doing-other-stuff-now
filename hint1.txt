Level 2: Hint 1
==============
Like the first level, you should have figured out how to list the files in this directory.

This S3 bucket has a .git file.  There are probably interesting things in it. Download this whole S3 bucket using:

```
aws s3 sync s3://level2-dd02c7c2232759874e1c205587017bed.flaws.cloud/ . --no-sign-request --region us-west-2
```
