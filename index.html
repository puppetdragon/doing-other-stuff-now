<h3>Lesson learned</h3>
On AWS you can set up S3 buckets with all sorts of permissions and functionality including using them to host static files.  A number of people accidentally open them up with permissions that are too loose.  Just like how you shouldn't allow directory listings of web servers, you shouldn't allow bucket listings.

<h4>Examples of this problem</h4>
<ul> 
  <li>Directory listing of S3 bucket of <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/163476">Legal Robot</a> and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/57505">Shopify</a>
  <li>Read and write permissions to S3 bucket for <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/98819">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/131468">Shopify again</a>, and 
  <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/111643">Udemy</a>.  This challenge did not have read and write permissions (as that would destroy the challenge for other players), but it is a common problem.
</ul>

The next level is fairly similar, with a slight twist.
